Data extracted from espncricinfo

After writing this [post](https://amalan-con-stat.netlify.com/post/webscraping/webscraping/) and with the end of the ICC ODI world cup
2019 I used my function to extract all the data. Also made a few changes in these data-sets to bring a unique large data-frame. 

I have also added the R script which includes all the code for the data extraction and large data-frame creation with comments.

*THANK YOU*
